# Termhold

A simple CLI colony management game written in Rust.

Manage resources, expand your settlement, assign workers and survive as long as possible.

# Implemented Mechanics

## Resources

- **Wood** — primary construction resource.
- **Stone** — primary construction resource.
- **Food** — required for survival and population growth.
- **Population** — provides workforce and determines colony expansion.

Population growth depends on available food and a random birth chance.
Building additional **Huts** increases the maximum population.

## Buildings

- [x] **Hut** — increases maximum population
- [x] **Lumber Yard** — passive wood production
- [x] **Stone Quarry** — passive stone production
- [x] **Farm** — passive food production
- [x] **Barn** — increases food storage capacity

# Mechanics Under Review

- [ ] Starvation (currently settlers die instantly one by one)

# Architecture Roadmap

## Core Data Model

- [ ] Replace `WorkerSite` with a shared `BuildingKind`
- [x] Introduce `ResourceKind`
- [ ] Replace building counters with `Building`
- [ ] Replace `Vec<String>` with structured `LogEntry`
- [ ] Expand `World`
  - [ ] Seasons
  - [ ] Weather
  - [ ] Difficulty
  - [ ] Game speed

## Configuration

- [x] Split `Balance` into nested structures

```text
Balance
├── GatherBalance
├── PopulationBalance
├── BuildingBalance
└── StorageBalance
```

## Commands & Actions

Replace specialized commands

```rust
BuildFarm
BuildBarn
BuildQuarry
...
```

with generic actions

```rust
Command::Build(BuildingKind)
Command::Demolish(BuildingKind)
Command::Gather(ResourceKind)
```

## Game Systems

Split game logic into independent systems.

- [ ] Production
- [ ] Population
- [ ] Workers
- [ ] Economy
- [ ] Storage
- [ ] Events

### Target architecture

```

## Engine

- [ ] Keep the game logic completely UI-independent
- [ ] Support multiple frontends
  - CLI
  - Ratatui
  - GUI (future)
- [ ] Replace direct UI interaction with `GameEvent`
- [ ] Separate input handling from game simulation

---

# Development Principles

- Keep game logic independent from the user interface.
- Prefer data-driven balancing through `Balance`.
- Avoid God Objects by splitting logic into independent systems.
- Prefer generic enums (`BuildingKind`, `ResourceKind`) over duplicated types.
- Keep simulation deterministic where possible.
- Separate **input → simulation → rendering**.

---

# Design Philosophy

**Termhold** focuses on **strategic colony management**, not individual settler simulation.

If a world map is introduced, it will primarily provide **spatial strategy** rather than micromanagement.

The map is intended to answer questions such as:

- Where should buildings be placed?
- Which terrain is best for production?
- How should the colony expand?

rather than simulate every settler's movement or daily routine.

**Termhold** focuses on strategic colony management with narrative-driven progression.

The colony evolves not only through economic decisions, but also through story events, difficult choices and long-term consequences.

# Long-Term Ideas

- [ ] AI-controlled colonies
- [ ] Diplomacy
- [ ] Multiple races
- [ ] Procedural world generation
- [ ] Save / Load system
- [ ] Mod support
- [ ] Ratatui interface
- [ ] Graphical (2D/3D) client
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Multiplayer
